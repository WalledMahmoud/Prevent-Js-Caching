# Prevent-Js-Caching
Prevents JavaScript files from being cached on WordPress by adding a version parameter to the URL.

### To prevent a JavaScript file from caching on a WordPress website, you can add a version number to the file's URL. This version number will be different each time the file is updated, which will force the browser to fetch the new version instead of using the cached version.
